<h1> this is being made for class to learn how to use all of the technology they teach us in class, i am unsure if i am doing everything 100% correctly but thats what we are here to learn about.</h1>

    <strong> "i am taking this course at SAIT which is the web developer program. it teaches you everything about a website and the coding that goes behind it, you really start from bare bones nothing and learn how to build every part of the website which is very interesting because you learn that a website has alot more behind it then a few pictures and some words."
